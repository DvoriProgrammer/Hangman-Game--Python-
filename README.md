Here are the rules for the Hangman game:

The game starts with an empty gallows, representing the hangman, and a blank word line representing the secret word.

The player guesses one letter at a time.

If the letter is in the secret word, all occurrences of that letter are revealed in the word line.

If the letter is not in the secret word, a body part of the hangman is added to the gallows.


Remember, the goal of the game is to guess the secret word before the hangman's body is complete. Good luck!
